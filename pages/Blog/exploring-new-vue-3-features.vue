			From the pixelated landscapes of Diablo 2 to the immersive worlds of Dark
			Cloud, my childhood was filled with adventures in gaming that shaped not
			only my leisure time but also my career path. Growing up with gaming
			consoles like the PlayStation 2 and Gameboy Advance, and spending hours
			tinkering with games like The Sims and Pok√©mon, I never imagined that
			these experiences would pave the way for a career in web development.

			As a kid, I was drawn into the mesmerizing realm of gaming. Each title
			offered a unique escape, whether it was battling demons in Diablo 2,
			rebuilding civilizations in Dark Cloud, or nurturing virtual lives in The
			Sims. These games weren't just sources of entertainment; they ignited my
			imagination and fueled my curiosity about technology.
